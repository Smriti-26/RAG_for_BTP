This chapter provides a technical assessment of *Water Resources of India*, framed by the global context of finite freshwater and the mechanics of the *hydrological cycle*, differentiating between *green water* (soil moisture) and *blue water* (groundwater and run-off). India's water availability is critically dependent on the *Asiatic monsoon*, particularly the *Southwest (SW) monsoon*, whose onset is governed by meteorological phenomena like *jet streams*, the *heat low*, and the *Tibetan high*. The total annual water resource is estimated at 4,000 km³, but high spatial and temporal variability, coupled with high *Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)*, limits usable supply. Surface water resources, organized into 20 primary *river basins*, total 1,869 km³, though only 690 km³ is deemed *potentially utilizable*. Declining *per capita water availability* is exacerbated by high water demand, primarily driven by *irrigation needs* (90% withdrawal), prompting the need for solutions like *inter-basin water transfers*. Groundwater resources (432 km³ replenishable) are analyzed based on *hydro-geological conditions*—*unconsolidated sediments*, *semi-consolidated sediments*, and *hard rocks*—which dictate aquifer properties like *transmissivity* and the distinction between *dynamic* and *static* resource components. A significant challenge is the prevalence of *saline groundwater resources* (EC > 4 dS/m) in arid and semi-arid regions, impacting water quality and sustainable utilization.
