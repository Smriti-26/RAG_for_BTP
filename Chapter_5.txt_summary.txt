Agrobiodiversity is the critical subset of biological diversity encompassing all agriculture-related species, including domesticated plants, animal breeds, microorganisms, and their wild relatives, providing essential **donor genetic stocks** for future agricultural improvement. Defined as the diversity of agricultural systems and all associated flora and fauna, it is crucial for ensuring stability in production, promoting **sustainable development**, facilitating **nutrient recycling**, and building **resilience** against **abiotic and climatic stress** conditions. The chapter highlights India's status as a **megadiverse country**, possessing significant **endemic biodiversity** and exhibiting 20 distinct **agroecological regions** (spanning arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, humid, and coastal ecosystems). India's rich agricultural heritage is demonstrated by over 380 cultivated crop species, 130 domesticated breeds, and numerous **landraces** and traditional cultivars, with several species—including *Oryza sativa* and *Cicer arietinum*—identified as **Centers of Origin (sensu Vavilov)**. Indicators of this richness include archaeological evidence of ancient agriculture dating back to the Neolithic age and the extensive distribution of **wild relatives of crop plants** (cereals, legumes, oilseeds, fruits, and spices) across India's diverse **phytogeographical zones**.
