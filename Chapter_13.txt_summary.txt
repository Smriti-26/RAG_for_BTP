This chapter outlines **Watershed Management (WM)** as the essential strategy for achieving the **Second Green Revolution** by focusing on sustainable development and resource conservation in **rainfed areas**. Operating under the **National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA)** and utilizing the **Watershed Development Programme (WDP)**, WM is conceptualized as an **integrated watershed management** approach requiring extensive **people’s participation**, **community-driven execution**, and a **bottom-up** planning methodology. Technical objectives include improving **soil organic matter (SOM)**, protecting water resources, moderating floods, and enhancing **water use efficiency** through techniques like **life saving irrigation** and **on-farm rainwater harvesting** (e.g., ridge-furrow configuration). The chapter details the **hydrology of the watershed**, including methods for **run-off estimation** (rational, Cook's, hydrologic soil-cover complex), and integrates land-use practices such as **Agroforestry** (agri-silvicultural systems) and **Joint Forest Management**. Tracing the evolution of WDPs, the text emphasizes the necessity of building **social capital** through institutional structures like **Self Help Groups (SHGs)** and **User Groups (UGs)**, ensuring equitable sharing of benefits from **Common Pool Resources (CPRs)**, and adopting a modern twin-track strategy combining high-technology tools (GIS, precision farming) with eco-friendly methods (**INM, NPM, ITK**).
