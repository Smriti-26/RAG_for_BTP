Post-harvest Technology (PHT) is defined as a multidisciplinary field encompassing various treatments and unit operations—such as cleaning, grading, drying, milling, fortification, packaging, and storage—applied from harvest to consumption to ensure food security, prevent significant post-harvest losses, and achieve value-addition. PHT is critical for conservation and for managing the high annual losses estimated between 8% (foodgrains) and 40% (horticultural produce).

Technical processes are commodity-specific. Cereal processing involves sophisticated milling techniques: wheat utilizes conditioning and the gradual-reduction process in roller mills to produce *atta*, *maida*, and *suji*, sometimes employing protein-displacement milling via air classification. Rice processing often includes parboiling, a hydro-thermal treatment that improves nutritive value and reduces kernel breakage during milling in modern sheller-type mills. Processing coarse grains like maize and sorghum requires degerming (to prevent rancidity) and employs both dry milling and wet milling for industrial starch extraction. Pulses undergo *dal*-milling, which involves dehusking and splitting, often requiring pre-milling treatments like alternate wetting and drying to optimize *dal* recovery. A core aspect of PHT is the utilization of co-products (e.g., rice husk, rice-bran oil extraction) and the reduction of anti-nutritional factors through methods like detoxification and fermentation.
