Apiculture, the science and culture of honeybees, is fundamental to crop productivity through *pollination* and the provision of valuable *bee-hive products* including *honey, bees wax, royal jelly*, and *propolis*. Modern *beekeeping* relies on standardized technology, notably the *movable frame-hive* based on *bee space*, the *honey extractor*, and the *smoker*. The chapter details four principal species: the wild *Apis florea* (little bee) and *Apis dorsata* (rock bee), and the domesticated *Apis cerana* (Indian bee, susceptible to *swarming* and *absconding*) and *Apis mellifera* (Western bee), which is commercially preferred globally for its high yield and extensive *foraging range*. Honeybees are *eusocial insects* organized into three castes (queen, worker, drone), exhibiting sophisticated *division of labour* and communication via the *dancing language* (*round dance* and *wagtail dance*) to signal food sources. Successful *apiary management* requires careful site selection and intensive *seasonal management* (spring, summer, winter), utilizing practices like *stimulative feeding* and *queen rearing* through *grafting* techniques. A major threat to colonies, particularly *Apis cerana*, is the viral pathogen, *Thai-sac brood disease*.
