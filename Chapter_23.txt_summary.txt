Chapter 23 details the definition, regulation, environmental fate, and analytical methodology surrounding *pesticide residues*. A pesticide, defined by the FAO, is any substance used for controlling pests and disease vectors, including those acting as plant-growth regulators. Regulation in India is governed by the *Insecticides Act, 1968*, overseen by the *Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB&RC)*, which manages the registration and banning of highly persistent *organochlorine pesticides* (e.g., Aldrin, DDT), favoring the introduction of effective, low-dose chemicals like *neo-nicotinoids*.

The environmental fate of these chemicals is determined by *persistence* and *transfer* processes (volatilization, leaching, run off), and *degradation* mechanisms (microbial degradation, photodegradation, co-metabolism). Pesticides resistant to degradation are categorized as *Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)*, which exhibit *bioaccumulation* through *bioconcentration* and *biomagnification*, often acting as *endocrine disruptors*. Regulatory standards utilize the *Maximum Residue Limit (MRL)*, a legal concentration limit established through *supervised field trials* conducted under *Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)* and *Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)*. MRLs are derived based on toxicological data, specifically the *Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)*. *Pesticide residue analysis* is a specialized field of analytical chemistry involving complex steps (extraction, cleanup, quantification) used to determine MRLs, persistence, and safe *pre-harvest intervals*.
