The chapter comprehensively details the evolution and impact of agricultural mechanization in India, driven by the need for timely field operations and increased cropping intensity, despite the prevalent constraint of small, scattered farm holdings. Historically reliant on manual and animal-operated tools (e.g., country plough, sickles), Indian agriculture has transitioned toward modern machinery, often accessed through custom-hiring. Mechanization has yielded substantial benefits, including 10–15% increases in crop productivity, 15–20% savings in inputs (seed, fertilizer), and significant reductions in time and labor. Institutional support from the ICAR, including the establishment of the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE) and All-India Co-ordinated Research Projects (AICRPs), has facilitated the development of location-specific equipment. Key technical advancements cover tillage (rotavators, laser-guided levelling), precision seeding (mechanically metered seed-cum-fertilizer drills, Zero Till Drill with inverted ‘T’ furrow openers, rice transplanters), interculture (mechanical weeders), and plant protection (ultra low-volume (ULV) and controlled droplet application (CDA) sprayers). Harvesting relies heavily on high-capacity mechanical power threshers (featuring spike-tooth cylinders) and self-propelled combine harvesters, including specialized straw combines for bhusa production. India is now a significant global exporter of general-purpose and specialized agricultural machinery, particularly tractors.
