This chapter details the complexity of **crop diseases**, defining them as abnormal physiological processes induced by continuous disturbance from a causal agent. Diseases are classified as either **infectious (biotic)**, involving organisms like fungi, prokaryotes, viruses, and nematodes, or **noninfectious (abiotic)**, caused by environmental factors like moisture stress or nutrient deficiencies. Accurate **disease diagnosis (symptomatology)** relies on differentiating local versus systemic symptoms, and classifying macroscopic expressions into categories such as **pre-necrotic, necrotic, hypoplastic, or hyperplastic/hypertrophic** (e.g., galls and cankers), alongside identifying specific pathogen **signs** (e.g., pycnidia, sclerotium). Technological advances in pathogen identification include specialized microscopy, serological tests like **ELISA** and **RIA** utilizing **monoclonal antibodies**, and molecular techniques like **DNA hybridization**. Pathogenesis disrupts critical plant functions, leading to syndromes such as **damping-off** (often caused by Oomycetous fungi like *Pythium* and *Phytophthora*) and **vascular wilts**. Effective control is achieved through **Integrated Disease Management (IDM)**, which emphasizes **disease surveillance**, quarantine, regulatory measures, and the use of resistant varieties, biological control agents (e.g., *Trichoderma* spp., **VAM** fungi), cultural practices (e.g., soil solarization), and judicious application of **chemotherapeutants**.
