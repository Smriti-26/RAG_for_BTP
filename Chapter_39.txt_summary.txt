India holds a unique distinction as the world’s second-largest silk producer, cultivating all five major silk varieties: the dominant **mulberry silk** (*Bombyx mori* on *Morus sp.*) and the four **Vanya silks**—endemic **muga** (*Antheraea assamensis*), **tropical tasar** (*Antheraea mylitta*), **oak tasar** (*Antheraea proylei* on *Quercus spp.*), and **eri** (*Philosamia ricini*). The industry, overseen by the **Central Silk Board** (CSB), relies primarily on **multivoltine** silkworm races, though extensive R&D efforts, notably through JICA and World Bank projects, focus on promoting **bivoltine** hybrids (e.g., CSR races) to produce high-grade raw silk (2A to 4A) suitable for the powerloom sector. Sericulture employs intensive cultivation practices utilizing improved *Morus* genotypes and **Integrated Nutrient Management Systems** (INMS). Pest management utilizes comprehensive **IPM** packages targeting the mulberry mealy-bug (*Maconellicoccus hirsutus*) causing **Tukra**, and the serious silkworm parasitoid **Uzifly** (*Exorista bombycis*), alongside disinfectants like **Vijetha** for viral and fungal diseases (pebrine, grasserie, muscardine). Post-cocoon technology is transitioning from the traditional **Charkha** to the **Multi-end Reeling Machine** to improve raw silk quality, which is marketed through regulated cocoon markets in major sericultural states like Karnataka.
