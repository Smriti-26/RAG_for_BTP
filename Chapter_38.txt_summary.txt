This chapter thoroughly analyzes Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) and its pivotal role in advancing sustainable agriculture and organic production systems within the Indian context. ITK is characterized as dynamic, holistic, tacit, and experiential local knowledge, often transmitted orally, which contrasts sharply with the reductionist Western scientific system. Recognizing its potential for developing eco-friendly technologies, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) executed the Mission Mode National Agricultural Technology Project (MM NATP) for the Collection, Documentation, and Validation of ITK (2000–2004). This comprehensive effort resulted in an inventory of 4,880 ITKs across 23 thematic areas, encompassing critical fields like pest and disease management, soil fertility, and post-harvest technology. A major component was the experimental validation of 111 ITKs, including cross-sectoral validation, which sought to quantify efficacy and identify active ingredients—such as oduvin in *Cleistanthus collinus* or alkaloids in *Strychnos nux-vomica*—in the plant and animal-based materials employed. The chapter concludes by advocating for the integration of validated ITK into scientific research, agricultural education (including RAWE programs), and extension mechanisms to form robust conjunctive management systems, while also stressing the necessity of protecting this traditional knowledge through Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Geographical Indications (GI).
