This chapter provides a detailed analysis of **Land Utilization** patterns and statistics in India, underscoring the vital significance of land resources for socio-economic development in the agriculture-dominant country. The core conceptual framework relies on the **9-fold land use classification**, which replaced the older 5-fold system in 1950-51 to ensure data comparability and facilitate agricultural planning. Statistical data, generally referenced against a **reporting area** of 305 million hectares (ha), quantifies the distribution of land categories. Key metrics indicate that **Arable land** constitutes approximately 54.4% of the reporting area, with the **Net area sown** covering 46.3% (141.4 million ha). Other critical classifications discussed include **Forest area** (around 22.9%), **Land put to non-agricultural uses**, **Barren and unculturable land**, and **Culturable wastelands**, noting trends like the decline of wastelands due to diversion. The analysis also focuses on productivity enhancement through metrics like **Cropping intensity** (calculated at 131.1% for 2000-01) and the expansion of irrigation facilities. Detailed figures are provided for **Net area irrigated** (55.1 million ha) and **Gross irrigated area** (76.6 million ha), highlighting the substantial portion dedicated to foodgrain crops. The chapter concludes by acknowledging the limited scope for extending cultivation and the long-term goals, such as the **National Forest Policy's** target of 33% forest cover.
