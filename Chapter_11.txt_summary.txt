This chapter outlines the critical environmental and **land degradation** challenges facing India, driven by unscientific resource exploitation, low **irrigation efficiency** (30-40%), and high livestock **grazing intensity**. The primary degradation process affecting an estimated 120.72 M ha is **soil erosion**, predominantly by water, resulting in an annual loss of 5,334 M tonnes of soil. The chapter details the forms of water erosion—including **sheet erosion**, **rill erosion**, and **gully erosion**—and the factors influencing them, such as precipitation intensity and land slope. Effective resource appraisal relies on comprehensive **Bench-mark Surveys** and systematic **Land Capability Classification** (Classes I–VIII, with sub-classes like *e*-Erosion or *s*-Root-zone limitations). A key technical concept for management is the **Soil Loss Tolerance Limit (T-value)**, which ranges from 2.5 to 12.5 tonnes/ha/year, guiding the prioritization of treatment areas. Conservation technologies are divided into **Agronomic Measures** and Mechanical Measures. Essential agronomic techniques for arable lands include non-monetary practices like **Contour farming**, which significantly reduces run-off and soil loss, and **Intercropping** (e.g., maize + cowpea) to increase ground cover, conserve *in-situ* rainwater, and ensure sustained agricultural productivity.
