This chapter details the critical shift from traditional, chemical pesticide-reliant pest control—which resulted in **environmental degradation**, **pest resistance**, **resurgence**, and harmful **pesticide residues**—to sustainable **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**. IPM, which is central to **Integrated Crop Management (ICM)**, emphasizes keeping pest populations (insects, diseases, nematodes) below the **Economic Threshold Level (ETL)** through ecologically sound techniques. Core IPM strategies include **cultural control** (e.g., crop rotation, synchronous planting) and robust **biological control**, focusing on the conservation and **augmentation of natural enemies** like **parasitoids** (*Trichogramma*) and **predators** (*Chrysoperla*). The approach also utilizes **biorationals** such as **biopesticides** (*Bacillus thuringiensis*, NPV) and plant products like **neem**, alongside **non-chemical methods** like **pheromones** for monitoring and **mating disruption**. Technological components include deploying **resistant varieties** and **transgenic crops** (e.g., **Bt cotton**), coupled with continuous **crop surveillance and monitoring** and the use of **pest forecasting models** based on biotic and abiotic factors. IPM ultimately seeks to provide food security while minimizing chemical inputs and adhering to international standards like **Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures**.
