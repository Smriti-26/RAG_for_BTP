This chapter provides a detailed examination of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), defining them as territorial legal rights that grant temporary **exclusive rights** over tangible creations of the human mind. The justification for IPR is rooted in **utilitarian arguments** and **economic efficiency**, aiming to provide an **incentive effect** for R&D investment while requiring full disclosure so the technology enters the **public domain** upon expiry. Key forms of IPR discussed include **Patents**—the strongest form, requiring **novelty**, **non-obviousness** (inventive step), and **industrial applicability**—along with **Trademarks**, **Geographical Indications**, and specific **Plant Variety Protection (PVP)** systems relevant to agriculture. The text highlights the shift in agriculture from viewing genetic resources as "common heritage" to proprietary control, increasing **transaction costs** and focusing attention on issues like **farmers’ rights** and **equitable benefit sharing**. Global IPR governance is largely shaped by the **TRIPS Agreement** (under the WTO), which standardizes protection, complemented by treaties like the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** and the **ITPGRFA**. Furthermore, the chapter stresses the necessity of documenting **prior art** and **traditional knowledge** (exemplified by the **Traditional Knowledge Digital Library - TKDL**) to prevent the erroneous grant of patents on existing public resources.
