The chapter provides an expert overview of oilseed crops in India, a leading global vegetable oil economy where the sector is second only to foodgrains in agricultural importance. India cultivates nine annual oilseeds, including seven edible types such as **groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, and soybean**. Historically, the sector underwent a transformation driven by the 1986 **Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO)**, resulting in the **Yellow Revolution** and significant production increases, though India remains a net importer of edible oils.

A major focus is **groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*)**, classified into subspecies *hypogaea* (Virginia group) and *fastigiata* (Spanish/Valencia group). The crop is predominantly self-pollinated, characterized by the unique formation of the **peg**—a positively geotropic stalk essential for subterranean pod development. Cultivation practices stress **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)**, requiring supplemental **calcium** and **sulphur** (often provided via **gypsum**) and seed inoculation with **Bradyrhizobium** strains for nitrogen fixation. Agronomic challenges include controlling pests like the **bruchid beetle** and diseases such as early/late leaf spots and **Peanut Bud Necrosis Disease**. Post-harvest management is critical, requiring drying to a low moisture content (8% for pods) to prevent fungal contamination by **Aspergillus flavus** and subsequent **aflatoxin** production. The chapter also discusses advanced techniques like **polythene mulching technology** to boost yields and water use efficiency.
