This chapter on Crop Biotechnology details the application of recombinant-DNA technology and genetic engineering to overcome sexual compatibility constraints and efficiently generate novel genetic variability in crop improvement programs. A central concept is Plant Tissue Culture (PTC), which leverages *totipotency* for essential applications like *micropropagation* of elite genotypes, production of *disease-free plants* via *meristem culture*, *in-vitro germplasm conservation*, and the commercial production of *secondary metabolites*. PTC is also foundational for *transgenic* technology, enabling the regeneration of whole plants from single transformed cells. Advanced breeding techniques discussed include the rapid development of 100% *homozygous* lines through the production of *doubled haploids* (DH) via anther/microspore culture, as well as methods to achieve *wide hybridization* and *introgression* of genes using *embryo culture* and *somatic hybridization* (protoplast fusion) to manipulate *organelle genomes* and create *cytoplasmic male sterile lines*. Furthermore, the text explores the use of *molecular markers* for *molecular mapping*, *gene tagging*, and *marker-aided selection* (MAS). Specific DNA markers described include *RFLP* (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), *STS* (Sequence Tagged Sites, including *CAPS*), *RAPD* (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA, leading to *SCARs*), and *STMS* (Sequence Tagged Microsatellite Sites or *SSRs*). The chapter also covers modern diagnostic kits utilizing protein- and DNA-based methods (e.g., PCR) for efficient pathogen identification and propagule certification.
