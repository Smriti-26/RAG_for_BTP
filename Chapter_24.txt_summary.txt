Nematodes, also known as threadworms or roundworms, are ubiquitous, multicellular, pseudocoelomate invertebrates characterized by a vermiform body and a life cycle involving four *juvenile stages* and sexual (*unisexual* or *dioecious*) or *parthenogenesis* reproduction. Plant-parasitic nematodes are diagnosed by a piercing *stylet* or *spear* used to inject *oesophageal gland secretions* for *extracellular digestion*, causing immense quantitative and qualitative crop losses globally (estimated 12.3%). These obligate parasites are classified by feeding habit: *ectoparasites*, *semi-endoparasites* (e.g., *Tylenchulus*, *Rotylenchulus*), and *endoparasites* (migratory or sedentary). Key genera include migratory endoparasites such as *Pratylenchus* (Root-lesion nematodes) and *Radopholus* (Burrowing nematodes), which cause *necrotic lesions*. Sedentary endoparasites like *Meloidogyne spp.* (Root-knot nematodes) induce characteristic root *galls* and *syncytia*, while *Heterodera* and *Globodera* form protective *cysts*. Economically significant above-ground pests include *Aphelenchoides besseyi* (White-tip disease) and *Anguina tritici* (ear-cockle disease). Furthermore, nematodes are crucial components of *disease complexes* with bacteria and fungi (e.g., Tundu disease) and function as vectors for soil-borne *NEPO* and *NETU* (*TOBRA*) viruses, transmitted by ectoparasites like *Xiphinema* and *Longidorus*. Management relies on integrated approaches, including *physiotherapeutic methods* (hot-water treatment), cultural practices, and *soil solarization*, aimed at maintaining population densities below the economic injury threshold.
