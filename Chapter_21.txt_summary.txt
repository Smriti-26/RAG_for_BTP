This chapter details the critical role of **Biological Control Agents (BCAs)**—including **predators**, **parasitoids**, and **entomopathogenic micro-organisms**—in managing significant crop yield losses (18-30%) in India. Key predators utilized include **Coccinellid beetles** (e.g., *Rodolia cardinalis*, *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*), **Green lacewings** (*Chrysoperla spp.*), and **Anthocorid bugs**. **Parasitoids** are classified as **endoparasitoids** or **ectoparasitoids**, and are crucial for both **classical biological control** (host-specific agents) and inoculative release, exemplified by the mass-produced, polyphagous **egg parasitoids** (*Trichogramma spp.*, including *T. chilonis* and *T. japonicum*) used against major lepidopteran pests like *Chilo spp.* and *Helicoverpa armigera*. Among **entomopathogens**, **bacteria** such as *Bacillus thuringiensis* (**Bt**), which produces the insecticidal **delta-endotoxin**, are commercially important and form the basis of **transgenics** like Bt cotton, while *Paenibacillus popilliae* is used against white-grubs. **Baculoviruses**, particularly **Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs)** and **Granuloviruses (GVs)**, are applied as commercial formulations (e.g., Hear-NPV, Spli-NPV) and measured in **POBs** (proteinic occlusion bodies). **Entomofungal pathogens** (*Beauveria bassiana*, *Metarrhizium anisopliae*, *Nomuraea rileyi*) are propagated using **fermentation technology**. Lastly, **Entomopathogenic Nematodes (EPNs)** (*Steinernema spp.*, *Heterorhabditis spp.*) utilize symbiotic bacteria (*Xenorhabdus/Photorhabdus*) to effectively control soil-inhabiting and cryptic insect-pests, especially under high-humidity conditions.
