The chapter on Cropping Systems details the immense agronomic and socio-economic diversity of Indian agriculture, defining practices based on distinct seasonal cycles: *kharif* (rainy), *rabi* (winter), and *zaid* (summer). It establishes various intensive cropping systems, including *monocropping*, *double cropping*, *multiple cropping*, *sequential cropping*, *relay cropping*, *mixed cropping*, and *intercropping*. System selection is driven by factors like profitability, ecological suitability, infrastructure, and achieving food and income security. Historically, post-Independence efforts, notably through the ICAR and the *All-India Co-ordinated Agronomic Experiments Scheme* (AICAES), focused on developing *High-Yielding Varieties* (HYV) and *photo-insensitive* cultivars to facilitate high-intensity cropping. This led to a major shift toward cereal-based systems, exemplified by the dominant *rice-wheat crop rotation* in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Research now emphasizes systems-based approaches to enhance *Land-Use Efficiency* (LUE) and sustainability, addressing issues like *plow pan* formation and efficient water management. The text identifies five broad agricultural regions (Rice, Wheat, Millet-Sorghum, Temperate Himalayan, Plantation) and details over 30 major prevalent cropping systems, including specialized techniques like *alley cropping* (e.g., with *Leucaena leucocephala*) and various profitable *intercropping* combinations suited to diverse *agro-climatic zones*.
