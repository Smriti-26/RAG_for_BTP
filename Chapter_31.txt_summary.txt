The transformation of Indian agriculture from a subsistence model to a technology-driven, semi-commercial system was driven significantly by robust **Agricultural Legislations** integrated into the **Five-Year Plans**. Early legislative efforts focused on reordering the agrarian structure through the **Abolition of Intermediaries (Zamindari)**, comprehensive **Tenancy Reforms**, and enforcing **Ceiling of Land holdings** to achieve social justice and redistribution. To protect these measures, many were incorporated into the **Ninth Schedule of the Constitution**. Further rationalization of the land-man relationship was achieved through acts mandating the **Consolidation of land-holdings** (e.g., the Bombay Prevention of Fragmentation and Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1948). Administrative jurisdiction rests primarily with the states (Entry No. 18, State List), but the Central government coordinates monitoring, including the distribution of surplus and wasteland, prevention of **alienation of tribal lands**, and the administration of the **Land Acquisition Act, 1894**. Modernization initiatives include the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for the **Computerization of Land Records (CLR)**. Legislative support for the Green Revolution led to strict **Input Management Legislations**, notably the **Seeds Act, 1966**, and regulation of fertilizers under the **Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (ECA)**. This framework includes specific orders like the **Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 (FCO)**, which governs quality, price, and sale, and the **Fertilizer (Movement Control) Order (FMCO)**, ensuring equitable distribution.
