The Indian National Agricultural Research System (NARS), championed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), details its evolution from tackling chronic food shortages in the 1960s to achieving national food self-sufficiency through the Green Revolution (driven by 'miracle seeds' of wheat and rice), followed by the White and Blue Revolutions. The chapter outlines the current shift in NARS priorities from pure production to sustainable development, focusing on complex challenges like declining factor productivity, managing climate change, and ensuring food and nutritional security. Major technical concerns include improving low water-use efficiency (with agriculture consuming 85% of resources), restoring soil health (addressing imbalanced N:P:K ratios and organic-carbon depletion), and mitigating biotic and abiotic stresses through proactive, anticipatory research and Integrated Pest Management (IPM). To maintain global competitiveness under the evolving WTO trade regime, which includes TRIPs and SPS measures, NARS is increasingly harnessing state-of-the-art technologies such as Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Bioinformatics, and Precision Farming utilizing GIS and remote sensing. Institutionally, the ICAR, supported by the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), has undergone periodic reviews to streamline its structure, develop specialized human resources through institutional accreditation, and establish Centres of Excellence for strategic research.
