This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of *Oryza sativa* (rice), a vital global staple whose cultivation spans four major ecosystems: *irrigated, rainfed lowland, rainfed upland*, and *flood-prone*. Taxonomically, rice belongs to the genus *Oryza* (family Gramineae), with the Asian *O. sativa* and African *O. glaberrima* being the two cultivated species, both A-genome diploids (2n=24). Genetic diversity is high, encompassing key subspecies *indica, japonica*, and *javanica*, which display varying degrees of photoperiod sensitivity and adaptation. The plant morphology is characterized by jointed culms, dimorphic roots, and a terminal panicle bearing self-pollinated spikelets that develop into a *caryopsis*. Cultivation utilizes traditional systems ranging from *Dry cultivation* to *Wet cultivation* involving *puddling* and *transplanting* using specialized nursery methods such as *wet nursery, dapog*, and *mat nursery*. Key management practices include maintaining optimal temperatures (20–35°C), applying split doses of NPK fertilizers (often using neem-cake or coaltar-coated urea, supplemented by biofertilizers like *Azolla*), and employing herbicides (e.g., Anilophos, Butachlor) for weed control. The text also covers specialized high-value crops like *Basmati rice* (known for aroma and grain elongation) and *Hybrid rice*, which exploits hybrid vigor through *CMS-fertility restoration* technology.
