This chapter provides a detailed analysis of the critical *agriculture-environment interactions* in India, moving from the successes of the *Green Revolution*—which significantly boosted *cereals productivity* and ensured *national food security* via *forest or land-saving agriculture*—to current challenges driven by sustained *population growth* and *globalization*. The primary threat is severe *environmental degradation*, particularly evident in intensive farming areas like the *Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP)*, where issues include *water-table recession*, declining *soil fertility*, *waterlogging*, *soil salinity*, and a *negative nutrient balance* due to high, inefficient fertilizer use. A major focus is *global climate change* and the emission of *Greenhouse Gases (GHG)*, specifically *methane (CH4)* from *enteric fermentation* and *wetland rice cultivation*, and *nitrous oxide (N2O)* resulting from low *fertilizer-use efficiency*. The agricultural sector accounts for 28% of India's total GHG emissions. Further complicating sustainability are issues of *water pollution* (from industrial effluents and agricultural nonpoint sources) and the bioaccumulation risk posed by *Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)* and *heavy metal toxicity*. To address these constraints and adhere to *UNFCCC* goals, the chapter emphasizes the need for advanced assessment tools, including *Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE)* technology and *crop growth simulation models* (like *InfoCrop*), to develop sustainable management practices that restore *agro-ecosystems*.
