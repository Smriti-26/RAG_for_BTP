This chapter details the essential strategies and technical considerations for the sustainable use of **low-quality waters** (L QW), including **brackish groundwaters** and recycled domestic/industrial wastewaters, within **irrigated agriculture** in arid and semi-arid regions. Indiscriminate use of L QW poses risks of **salinity**, **sodicity** (alkalinity), and **specific-ion toxicity** (e.g., Fluoride, Arsenic, Nitrate), necessitating strict management. Water quality suitability is determined using parameters like **Electrical Conductivity (EC)**, **Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)**, and **Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC)**, supplemented by **BOD** and **COD** for wastewaters. Management strategies emphasize developing **site-specific guidelines** based on soil texture, rainfall, and crop tolerance. For saline waters, techniques include selecting **salt-tolerant cultivars**, optimizing irrigation frequency, utilizing **micro-irrigation systems**, and employing **multi-quality irrigation** (blending or cyclic use) to maximize **salt leaching** during monsoon periods. For **alkali waters** (high RSC), the core management technique is the application of **calcium-bearing amendments** like **gypsum** to neutralize residual alkalinity, mitigate permeability issues, and reduce the **Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP)** in the root zone.
