The chapter provides a comprehensive agronomic overview of sugarcane (*Saccharum spp.*), a vital commercial cash crop contributing significantly to the global sugar pool, detailing specific cultivation requirements. Optimal growth necessitates heavy, well-drained loams with a pH of 6.5–7.5, and a warm humid climate for vegetative growth (best tillering at 30-35°C), transitioning to a cool, dry season crucial for ripening and high sucrose recovery percentage. Key cultivation practices include intensive preparatory tillage, the application of organic manures (e.g., pressmud), and complex cropping systems such as rotation (e.g., rice-wheat-sugarcane-ratoon) and various intercropping arrangements utilizing paired-row geometry. Seed material quality is managed via the Three-tier Seed Programme, employing specialized heat treatment methods (moist hot air treatment, aerated steam therapy) and micropropagation/tissue culture to ensure pathogen-free setts, which are often treated with fungicides (Carbendazim) and insecticides (Chlorpyriphos) prior to planting. Planting techniques vary geographically (flat, furrow, trench planting) and seasonally (eksali, adsali, autumn planting), with mechanization utilizing devices like the IISR cutter-planter. Advanced methods such as the ring-pit method, Spaced Transplanting (STP), and polybag-raised settlings are utilized to maximize stalk population and seed multiplication ratio. Irrigation management is critical, with high water requirements (2,000–3,000 mm in tropics) optimized through water-saving techniques like skip-furrow irrigation, trash-mulching, and micro-irrigation systems (drip and sprinkler), which also enable efficient fertigation and improved water-use efficiency (WUE).
