The chapter details the critical challenges and strategies for enhancing **Forage Crops and Grasses** production in India, essential for sustaining the world's largest livestock population, which currently suffers from low productivity. The primary constraint is a severe national feed supply deficit, notably 61.1% green fodder and 64% total feeds, resulting in shortages of **Crude Protein (CP)** and **Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN)**. Key cultivated fodders include *Sorghum* (kharif) and *berseem* (Egyptian clover) (rabi). Strategies to meet demand focus on **Forage Crop Improvement**, utilizing India's rich genetic diversity in *Gramineae* and *Leguminosae* genera (e.g., *Stylosanthes, Dichanthium, Leucaena*). Breeding objectives prioritize high dry matter yield, enhanced quality metrics (high *in-vitro dry-matter digestibility*, low *neutral detergent fibre*), and improved stress tolerance. **Biotechnological approaches** are central, employing techniques like *embryo rescue*, *genetic transformation*, and molecular markers (*RFLP, AFLP, RAPD*) for **germplasm characterization** and **QTL identification**. Production systems emphasize **Intensive Irrigated Systems** and **Multiple Cropping** through year-round forage sequences—such as inter-planting perennial grasses like **Hybrid Napier** with legumes—to achieve high yields (up to 300 tonnes green fodder/ha/year) and address regional availability imbalances.
