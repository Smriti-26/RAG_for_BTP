Agroforestry (AF) is an ancient, integrated land-use system defined as the deliberate combination of woody perennials (trees, shrubs, etc.) with herbaceous crops and/or animals, managed either spatially or temporally, to yield both wood and food while simultaneously conserving and rehabilitating ecosystems. Recognized for its critical *productive* and *service* roles, AF is essential for addressing demographic pressure and mitigating land degradation (soil erosion, salinization, waterlogging) by enhancing nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation, and micro-climate improvement. Modern scientific inquiry into AF was formalized globally by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF, now World Agroforestry Centre) and in India by the ICAR-supported All-India Coordinated Research Project on Agroforestry. AF systems are categorized structurally, functionally, and socio-economically. Structural classification highlights specific technical combinations, including *Agri-silviculture* (trees + crops), *Silvi-pasture* (trees + pasture), *Agri-horticulture* (fruit trees + crops), *Alley cropping* (perennial hedges + crops), and protective measures like *Wind-breaks* and *Shelter-belts*. Unlike general tree-planting programs such as Social Forestry or Farm Forestry, AF emphasizes the required biological and economical interactions between components, ensuring multiple outputs and the sustainable management of natural resources.
