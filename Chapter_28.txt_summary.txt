This chapter provides an extensive analysis of agricultural marketing and trade in India, tracing its evolution from decentralized, exploitation-prone private systems (pre-1960s) to a highly commercialized structure post-Green Revolution, evidenced by a significantly high Marketed Surplus Ratio (MSR). Marketing's role has expanded beyond transfer functions to include price discovery and the transmission of price signals between farm and non-farm sectors. The institutional backbone is the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation Act (APMRA), which created regulated markets (mandis) and Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to ensure transparent, open auction sales and safeguard producers' interests against malpractices. Direct government intervention is managed by institutions like the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), which administer the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, procurement operations, and maintenance of buffer stock for the Public Distribution System (PDS). Modernizing efforts, such as the Model APMC Act, facilitate contract farming and direct transactions (e.g., Apni Mandi), while the legal framework utilizes the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and AGMARK grading for quality assurance. Critical infrastructure requirements include expanding the network of regulated markets, upgrading physical facilities like cold storage for perishables, and strengthening institutional support via cooperative organizations like NAFED.
