The chapter comprehensively details the landscape, constraints, and production systems of **Hill Agriculture** across India's hilly and mountainous regions, including the extensive **Himalayas**. These areas are vital repositories of **biodiversity** and are defined by **six mountain specificities**: fragility, marginality, inaccessibility, heterogeneity, natural instability, and human adaptation. Key components of the hill **agro-ecosystem** are integrated systems involving crop production, livestock, horticulture, and **agro-forestry**. Resource management is paramount, focusing on diverse **soil resources**, critical **water resources** (surface flow, groundwater, major river basins), and climatic variability (tropical to temperate zones). Agricultural development is hampered by resource degradation, unscientific farming on marginal lands, and inadequate location-specific technology. Regional production systems vary: the **Western Himalayan Region** features cereal-based farming, specialized **horti-production systems** (temperate fruits like apple), off-season vegetable cultivation, and **agri-horti-silvi-pastoral** models often integrated with transhumance-based livestock. In contrast, the **North-Eastern Himalayan Region (NEH)** is dominated by **shifting cultivation** (**jhum** or **swidden**), a subsistence, **slash-and-burn**, **zero-tillage** practice. Due to increased demographic pressure, reduced **jhum cycles** (3–5 years) accelerate severe **soil erosion** (up to 170 tonnes/ha/year), necessitating solutions for sustainable resource utilization and agricultural productivity.
