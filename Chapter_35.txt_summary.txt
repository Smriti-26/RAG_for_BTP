This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of **Seed Production and Technology**, defining seed broadly as a viable **propagule** (fertilized ovule or vegetative material) and detailing its function as a **value-added input** through **seed enhancement** and **seed coating** for delivering chemical treatments and nutrients. The Indian system utilizes a **limited generations seed multiplication system**, wherein new varieties undergo rigorous multi-location testing via the **All-India Co-ordinated Crop Improvement Projects (AICCIP)** for **Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU)** assessment leading to official **Notification and Release**. Seed classes are sequentially produced: **Nucleus seed**, **Breeder seed** (guaranteeing genetic purity), **Foundation seed**, and **Certified seed**, forming a three-generation chain. Seed supply is managed through the **formal seed sector** (including public organizations like ICAR, NSC, and State Seed Corporations, and private companies) and the **informal seed sector** (farm-saved seed), with increasing integration via **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)**. Core production methodology stresses maintaining strict **Isolation Distance** to prevent **genetic contamination** and cross-pollination, careful **Roguing** of off-type and diseased plants, and advanced **Seed Processing** techniques like cleaning, grading, and using a **gravity separator**. Specialized production systems, such as the **Seed Plot Technique** for potato tubers and **micropropagation** for horticultural crops, are discussed, alongside **aquaculture seed production**, which relies on **induced breeding** technologies to supply various stages of fish seed (**spawn, fry, fingerlings**).
