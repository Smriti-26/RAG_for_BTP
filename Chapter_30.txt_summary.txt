Agricultural Extension is defined as an *applied behavioural science* and a full-fledged academic discipline dedicated to the *dissemination* and *practical application* of *scientific and technological innovations* to effect desirable changes in the behaviour of rural populations. Its operation is governed by specific *principles of extension education*, emphasizing the *principle of interests and needs*, *cultural differences*, *participation*, *adaptability*, *whole family approach*, and a *democratic approach* rooted in *grass-root organization* and the involvement of *local leadership*. The core strategy involves an *educational process* utilizing specialized *extension teaching methods*. These methods are categorized by the *nature of contact* (i.e., *individual contact*, *group contact*, or *mass-or community-contact*) and include technical approaches such as *Result demonstration*, *Method demonstration*, *Frontline demonstration*, *Agricultural clinic*, and *Peripatetic team visits*. To create effective *learning situations*, extension workers employ diverse *visual aids* (e.g., *Posters*, *Flannel graphs*, *Slides*, *Film strips*) and innovative pedagogical tools like *Agricultural games*. Ultimately, the success of extension is measured through constant *evaluation and improvement*, assessing changes in the people’s *knowledge, skill, attitude, and adoption behaviour*.
