This chapter provides an expert overview of *Water Management and Crop Production* in India, emphasizing the constraints imposed by scarce *per capita water availability* (below the $1,700 \text{ m}^3$ stress level) and the imperative to increase *water utilization efficiency* across both irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Historically, mismanagement, particularly issues related to *salt and water balance* and subsequent *waterlogging* and *salinity*, led to the decline of ancient irrigation-based civilizations. India must leverage its *Ultimate Irrigation Potential* ($139.5 \text{ Mha}$) to raise current low yields ($2.5 \text{ tonnes/ha}$ irrigated) and achieve sustainable food security. A major focus is *Rainwater Management* for the $41\%$ of arable land that remains rainfed, utilizing techniques like *in-situ water conservation*, *contour bunding*, *graded terracing*, and *water harvesting structures* (farm ponds, percolation ponds) for *supplemental irrigation* and *groundwater recharge*. Technical details are provided on measuring *point rainfall* using *non-recording* and *recording rain gauges* and calculating average rainfall via methods such as the *Thiessen Polygon* and *isohyetal method*. The text also introduces the critical concept of *dependable rainfall*, calculated as a *stochastic hydrologic variable* using the *Ranking Method* and *Recurrence Interval* (RI), to better design conservation strategies. Effective irrigation management necessitates minimizing high *conveyance losses* in canal systems and ensuring proper *land drainage* to maintain the ideal *soil-water-plant relationship* (soil moisture between *field capacity* and $50\%$ of field capacity).
