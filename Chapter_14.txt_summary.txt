This chapter details the essential technical and policy frameworks for efficient **Irrigation and Drainage Management**, crucial for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. It outlines India's substantial water resources (estimated ultimate irrigation potential of 140 M ha) and institutional efforts, such as the **Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM)** program, which focuses on **on-farm development (OFD)** works and the implementation of the **Warabandi** rotation system. A central focus is determining crop water needs, defined by the **irrigation requirement (IR)**, which accounts for **effective rainfall (ER)** and losses through **evapotranspiration (ET)**, or **consumptive use (CU)**. Accurate ET measurement is achieved using **lysimeters** (weighing and non-weighing) and predictive models like the **Penman-Monteith method**, which utilize local **crop coefficients ($K_c$)** often calculated via the **CROPWAT model**. Irrigation **scheduling** criteria are based on replenishing the **soil moisture deficit** back to **field capacity (FC)**, timing irrigations according to **physiological stages**, and utilizing meteorological parameters. The chapter contrasts low-efficiency **surface irrigation** methods (border, furrow, check basin), which contribute to waterlogging, with high-efficiency pressurized systems: **sprinkler irrigation** and **drip irrigation**. These advanced systems offer significant water savings and improved water-use efficiency, critical for sustainable resource management and mitigating issues like soil salinity.
