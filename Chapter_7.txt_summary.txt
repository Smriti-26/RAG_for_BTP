This chapter provides an exhaustive treatment of soils, defining them as subaerial natural objects formed through complex **pedogenic factors** including climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time. Soil genesis begins with **weathering**—the physical and chemical disintegration of **igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks**. Key chemical processes covered include **hydrolysis, hydration, carbonation, and oxidation/reduction**, which transform primary minerals (like quartz and feldspars) into **secondary minerals** such as clays. Soil development is analyzed through the **soil profile**, a vertical sequence of **horizons (O, A, E, B, C, R)**, where the A and E horizons are zones of **eluviation** and the B horizon is the zone of **illuviation**. The solid phase of soil is characterized by its **texture** (sand, silt, clay fractions) and **clay mineralogy**. Dominant **aluminosilicate** clay types are categorized by structure: **1:1 type (kaolinitic)** with low **cation exchange capacity (CEC)**, and **2:1 type (smectite, vermiculite)** with high CEC, controlling properties like plasticity and cohesion. Critical physical properties—including **particle density, bulk density, pore space** (macro/micro), and color (measured by the **Munsell Colour Chart**)—are discussed for their influence on water retention and aeration. The chapter concludes by noting the importance of the gaseous phase and the **Oxygen Diffusion Rate (ODR)** for root respiration and microbiological activity.
