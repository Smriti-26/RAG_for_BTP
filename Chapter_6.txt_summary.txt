Desertification is defined internationally as land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid drylands, resulting from climatic variations and human activities, and currently affects 70% of global dryland ecosystems. These vulnerable regions are characterized by a negative water balance, classified by a low ratio of annual precipitation (P) to potential evapo-transpiration (PET). The core mechanisms of desertification involve the reduction of resource potential through accelerated soil erosion (water and wind/aeolian processes), salinization, waterlogging, and physical deterioration like soil compaction and crusting. Crucially, desertification leads to the depletion of the soil organic-carbon pool and a reduction in net primary productivity (NPP). Human mismanagement—including overgrazing, deforestation, inappropriate land-use, and faulty irrigation—is the primary driver of accelerated degradation. Environmental impacts include significant contributions to climate change (by altering the ground-surface-energy budget, increasing dust, and reducing the global carbon-dioxide sink), loss of global biological diversity, and changes in the hydrological regime. Socio-economically, desertification results in the loss of productive land, reduced agricultural output, economic instability, and forced migration, directly threatening food and livelihood security. Global assessments (e.g., UNCOD, GLASOD) confirm that human-induced soil degradation, especially water erosion in wetter dryland areas and wind erosion in arid zones, remains a critical challenge.
