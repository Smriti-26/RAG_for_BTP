The chapter on **Weed Management** outlines the negative impact of ubiquitous weeds, which significantly reduce **crop yields** through resource competition, acting as alternate hosts for pests, and releasing **allelochemicals** (leading to **interference**). Weeds are characterized by prolific seed production, long **seed viability** (e.g., *Convolvulus arvensis*), and rapid growth, classified by life cycle (annuals, biennials, perennials) and parasitic nature (e.g., *Striga*, *Cuscuta*). Management strategies include Prevention, Eradication, and Control, which must be optimized during the **critical period of weed competition** (typically 15–60 days after sowing). Control utilizes physical, cultural (crop rotation, intercropping), and **biological control** methods (e.g., *Zygogramma bicolorata*). A central component of modern technology is the application of **herbicides**, classified by chemistry (e.g., phenoxys, triazines), selectivity (selective/non-selective, e.g., **Atrazine**, **Glyphosate**), mode of action (contact/translocated, e.g., **2,4-D**), and timing (**pre-emergence (PE)**, **post-emergence (POE)**). The text addresses the global concern of **herbicide resistance** and the development of **Herbicide-Resistant Crops (HRCs)**. Finally, practices like **conservation tillage** (zero-tillage), which rely heavily on contact herbicides for pre-planting control, are integrated into an overall **Integrated Weed Management (IWM)** system.
