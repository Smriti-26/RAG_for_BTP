Farm Management is a decision-making science focused on the organization and operation of farms to maximize profitability and raise the living standard of farming people, integrating complex information within the economic framework of resource restrictions, scarcity, and alternative uses. This discipline evaluates opportunity costs and the optimal enterprise mix across the entire farm as an operational unit. Core management decisions involve determining the optimal enterprise combination, the efficient methods of production, and the appropriate size of the farm business. Key analytical tools include **Farm Planning**—a systematic approach to incorporating technological developments and economic situations—and **Farm Budgeting**, which monetarily estimates costs, returns, and net profit. Budgeting techniques are categorized into **partial budgeting** (analyzing a segment), **enterprise budgeting** (for specific activities), and **complete budgeting** (for total farm reorganization). Effective planning requires specifying **technical coefficients of production**, appropriate prices, and creating an inventory of limited resources. Farm efficiency is measured by the output-to-input ratio, relying on standardized **Cost Concepts** such as **Cost A1, Cost A2, Cost B, and Cost C** (a comprehensive measure incorporating imputed rental value of owned land and family labor), alongside variable and fixed costs. This analysis is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, managing farm credit, and determining the relative profitability of farming systems like multiple cropping and crop rotations.
