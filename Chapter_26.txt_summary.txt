This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of farm power and energy trends in Indian agriculture, documenting the massive shift from animate power (human and draught animal power/DAP) to electro-mechanical power sources, including tractors, power tillers, diesel engines, and electric motors. This transition has increased the ratio of mechanical energy over total farm energy to 87.6% (2003-04) and raised farm power intensity to 1.5 kW/ha. Energy consumption is dominated by irrigation (51% of total input), driving increased use of subsidized electricity and diesel, which now accounts for 21% of total rural consumption. The chapter details the substantial potential of renewable energy sources, including bioenergy (biomass, fuel wood, animal dung) utilizing technologies like biogas plants, direct combustion systems, and gasification (e.g., down-draught gasifiers producing producer gas). It also discusses liquid biofuels, such as biodiesel derived via trans-esterification, as substitutes for high-speed diesel in compression ignition engines, alongside solar energy (SPV and thermal routes) and wind energy. Crucially, the text emphasizes energy conservation technology, promoting water management (drip/sprinkler irrigation) and conservation tillage practices like zero-till drilling and roto-drilling to improve fuel efficiency and reduce operational energy inputs, while also looking ahead to technologies like high horsepower tractors, GPS integration, and hydrogen fuel cells (PEMFC).
